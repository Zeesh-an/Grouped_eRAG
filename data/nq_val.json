    "<P> The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . </P>"

If all the realms are destroyed , Fiona would gain unchecked powers and be able to break the Laws of Magic at will . In the Enchanted Forest , the banished characters gather at Regina 's castle ; David and Hook obtain a magic bean and the Evil Queen sacrifices herself , holding off the Darkness to delay the group 's destruction . Fiona convinces Emma to destroy the book , but Henry hand - draws one that restores her belief in time to save everyone in the castle . Gold kills Fiona , who had hidden Belle and turned her into a coward ; this breaks the Curse , which restores everyone 's memories and reunites them in Storybrooke . However , Gideon is still under orders to kill Emma . Gold attempts to free Gideon 's heart ; however , a spell cast by the Black Fairy prevents him from doing so . Emma lays down her sword , allowing Gideon to impale her ; this releases Emma 's light magic and ends the battle . With both Gold and Emma having chosen good , Gideon is returned to infancy and the realms are restored , and those who died in the crisis are revived . The characters embark on their `` happy beginnings . '' Many years later in the New Enchanted Forest , an adult Henry vanishes while defending his daughter Lucy from an unidentified entity . Guided by Tiger Lily , Lucy travels to Seattle , where Henry no longer remembers her . </Td> </Tr> </Table>"

The + is a simplification of the Latin `` et '' ( comparable to the ampersand & ) . The \u2212 may be derived from a tilde written over m when used to indicate subtraction ; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself . In his 1489 treatise Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols \u2212 and + as minus and mer ( Modern German mehr ; `` more '' ) : `` was \u2212 ist , das ist minus , und das + ist das mer '' . They were n't used for addition and subtraction here , but to indicate surplus and deficit ; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518 . </P>"

  "where can pulse be felt in the body": [
    "<P> In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) . Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) . The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology . </P>"
